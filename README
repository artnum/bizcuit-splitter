PDF Splitter
------------

Split a PDF into multiple file where the separator page is found. It is
designed to scan a bunch of documents by just adding a page at the separation
point.

For recto-verso scanning, printing both side of with the separator page should
do the trick. I haven't, yet, tested because I don't own a recto-verso scanner.

The resulting PDFs will be rotated correctly if the separator page is oriented
as the document.

The serpartor page need to be put AFTER the document. If all the documents in
the stack are oriented the same way, you don't need to put the last separator
page.
